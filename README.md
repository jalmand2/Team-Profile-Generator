# Team Profile Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This is a Team Profile Generator designed to be ran in the terminal and relies on different packages like inquirer to prompt questions and jest to run tests on the files, eventually resulting in an HTML file being created. The prompts ask questions regarding the role of team members and their personal information to display in the file. I learned how to install dependencies, run tests on files, and relying on user inputs in a terminal using node.js in order to generate a file.
